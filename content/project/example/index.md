Excerpt from the research paper, researched and written in collaboration with Lieke Hevink, Katerina Jostova, Jessica Papini and Dovilé SmagurauskaitéLorem. 

'Just a few days before everything in society was brought to a halt due to Covid-19, we stepped into OP’s office for our, unbeknownst to us, last in-person meeting with Jennifer and Niels. Due to lockdown measures, it became impossible for us to meet the architects and their fellow team members in person or to follow a specific design project as we had previously intended. Instead, we draw on OP’s previous projects that best illustrate their approach. This has led to the current formulation of the research theme and to the reevaluation of our methodology. Information about the projects was gathered during interviews with the partners and OP’s members, and was complemented by documentation we gained access to through their website.'

'To understand the chosen architecture firm's philosophy and get acquainted with their perception of the Danish architecture field and their ideals of architectural practices, we interviewed the partners, Jennifer Dahm Petersen, Niels Lund Petersen and Skafte Aymo-Boot, as well as five other present and past members of the firm. In total twelve in-depth interviews were carried out. Two of these were unstructured interviews that were conducted during our introductory meetings in their office in Nørrebro. The remaining ten semi-structured interviews were carried out through video calls and phone conversations due to the situation caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.'

The research study follows and compares the ideologies presented on an architectures website and their ideals in practice. In this study we concluded that in order to push forward sustainable ideals one must speak about it and attempt to encourage clients to move towards socially and environmental sustainablity, all the while keeping a float in the challenging architectural field and landscape. 

'Since sustainability is a recent, albeit growing, topic of concern, OP sees the necessity for challenging the architectural regime. As it stands, companies such as OP who have a resounding drive to implement sustainability in their designs still face an uphill battle to overcome the hegemonic regime. For OP, the most realistic outcome is to continue making compromises that lead to a balance between their philosophy and the antagonistic reality of the regime. The hope, as is exemplified on OP’s website, is that the future of architecture will be saturated with deeper considerations for social and environmental sustainability. The future, just like OP, is open to a myriad of possibilities, outcomes and platforms for change.'
